class Bart(Module):
    R"""
    Nonparametric regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART).

    Regress `y_train` on `x_train` with a latent mean function represented as
    a sum of decision trees [2]_. The inference is carried out by sampling the
    posterior distribution of the tree ensemble with an MCMC.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_train
        The training predictors.
    y_train
        The training responses. For univariate regression, a 1D array of shape
        `(n,)`. For multivariate regression, a 2D array of shape `(k, n)` where
        `k` is the number of response components, as introduced in [3]_. For
        binary regression, the convention is that non-zero values mean 1, zero
        mean 0, like booleans.
    outcome_type
        The type of regression. ``'continuous'`` for continuous regression,
        ``'binary'`` for binary regression with probit link. For multivariate
        regression, a scalar value applies to all components; alternatively, a
        sequence of per-component types (e.g., ``['binary', 'continuous']``)
        specifies mixed outcome types. Binary components in multivariate
        outcomes follow the multivariate probit BART formulation of [4]_.
    sparse
        A `SparseConfig` for the sparsity-inducing variable selection prior of
        [1]_. Disabled by default; pass a `SparseConfig` to enable it.
    varprob
        The probability distribution over the `p` predictors for choosing a
        predictor to split on in a decision node a priori. Must be > 0. It does
        not need to be normalized to sum to 1. If not specified, use a uniform
        distribution. If `sparse` is enabled, this is used as initial value for
        the MCMC.
    binner
        A callable that, given the training predictors and a random key,
        returns a `~bartz.prepcovars.Binner` instance. The default is
        `~bartz.prepcovars.UniqueQuantileBinner`, which places cutpoints at
        the quantiles of each predictor. Other built-in options are
        `~bartz.prepcovars.RangeEvenBinner` (evenly-spaced cutpoints over the
        observed range) and `~bartz.prepcovars.GivenSplitsBinner` (R BART
        ``xinfo`` format). To pass options, use `functools.partial`, e.g.
        ``binner=partial(UniqueQuantileBinner, max_bins=128)``.
    rm_const
        How to treat predictors with no associated decision rules (i.e., there
        are no available cutpoints for that predictor). If `True` (default),
        they are ignored. If `False`, an error is raised if there are any.
    sigma_df
        The degrees of freedom of the prior on the error precision. For
        multivariate regression with `k` components, the Wishart degrees of
        freedom are set to ``sigma_df + k - 1``.
    sigma_scale
        Sets the scale of the prior on the error precision. If 'auto'
        (default), the prior is scaled so that the error precision equals
        ``diag(1 / var(y_train))`` in expectation, where with `error_scale` the
        variance is a precision-weighted one that estimates the error variance
        at unit error scale. Otherwise, ``square(sigma_scale)`` is the prior
        harmonic mean of the error variance; for multivariate regression a
        scalar is broadcast to all components. For mixed outcome types, binary
        components are ignored.
    sigma_init
        The initial value of the error standard deviation in the MCMC. If
        'auto' (default), the initial error precision is set to ``diag(1 /
        var(y_train))``, with the same precision-weighted variance as
        `sigma_scale` when `error_scale` is given. Otherwise, the initial
        precision is ``diag(1 / square(sigma_init))``; for multivariate
        regression a scalar is broadcast to all components. For mixed outcome
        types, binary components are ignored.
    k
        The inverse scale of the prior standard deviation on the latent mean
        function, relative to half the observed range of `y_train`. If `y_train`
        has less than two elements, `k` is ignored and the scale is set to 1.
    power
    base
        Parameters of the prior on tree node generation. The probability that a
        node at depth `d` (0-based) is non-terminal is ``base / (1 + d) **
        power``.
    tau_num
        The numerator in the expression that determines the prior standard
        deviation of leaves. If not specified, default to ``(max(y_train) -
        min(y_train)) / 2`` (or 1 if `y_train` has less than two elements) for
        continuous regression, and 3 for binary regression. For multivariate
        regression, the range is computed per component. For mixed outcome
        types, each component uses the default for its type.
    offset
        The prior mean of the latent mean function. If not specified, it is set
        to the mean of `y_train` for continuous regression, and to
        ``Phi^-1(mean(y_train != 0))`` for binary regression. If `y_train` is
        empty, `offset` is set to 0. With binary regression, if `y_train` is
        all zero or all non-zero, it is set to ``Phi^-1(1/(n+1))`` or
        ``Phi^-1(n/(n+1))``, respectively. For multivariate regression, can be
        a scalar (broadcast to all components) or a `(k,)` vector. If not
        specified, it is set to the per-component mean of `y_train`. For mixed
        outcome types, each component uses the default for its type.
    error_scale
        Coefficients that rescale the error standard deviation on each
        datapoint ("w" in BART3). Not specifying `error_scale` is equivalent to
        setting it to 1 for all datapoints. Shape ``(n,)`` applies the same
        scalar scale to every outcome component; for multivariate regression,
        ``(k, n)`` instead supplies a per-component scale per datapoint.
        Supported with binary (probit) outcomes, where it scales the latent
        error so the success probability is ``Phi(latent / error_scale)``,
        including the binary components of a mixed regression.
    missing
        Boolean mask with the same shape as `y_train`; `True` marks entries
        to be ignored by the MCMC. The values of `y_train` at masked
        positions are ignored and may be anything, even non-finite. If 2-D,
        the error covariance must be diagonal.
    num_trees
        The number of trees used to represent the latent mean function.
    n_save
        The number of MCMC samples to save, after burn-in, per chain. The
        total trace length across all chains is ``num_chains * n_save``.
    n_burn
        The number of initial MCMC samples to discard as burn-in. This number
        of samples is discarded from each chain.
    n_skip
        The thinning factor for the MCMC samples, after burn-in.
    printevery
        The number of iterations (including thinned-away ones) between each log
        line. Set to `None` to disable progress reporting entirely (this ignores
        `pbar`). ^C interrupts the MCMC only every `printevery` iterations, so
        with reporting disabled it's impossible to kill the MCMC conveniently.
    pbar
        If `True`, show a `tqdm` progress bar instead of printing log lines. The
        bar advances every iteration and refreshes the acceptance statistics
        every `printevery` iterations. Ignored if `printevery` is `None`.
    num_chains
        The number of independent Markov chains to run.

        The difference between ``num_chains=None`` and ``num_chains=1`` is that
        in the latter case in the object attributes and some methods there will
        be an explicit chain axis of size 1.
    num_chain_devices
        The number of devices to spread the chains across. Must be a divisor of
        `num_chains`. Each device will run a fraction of the chains. If 'auto'
        (default) and running on cpu, the number of devices is picked
        automatically based on the number of cores and the number of available
        devices (all the virtual jax cpu devices, or the `devices` list if set).
    num_data_devices
        The number of devices to split datapoints across. Must be a divisor of
        `n`. This is useful only with very high `n`, about > 1000_000. `predict`
        parallelizes across the same devices, splitting the test points; the
        number of test points must be a multiple of `num_data_devices` as well.

        If both num_chain_devices and num_data_devices are specified, the total
        number of devices used is the product of the two.
    devices
        One or more devices used to run the MCMC on. If not specified, the
        computation will follow the placement of the input arrays. If a list of
        devices, this argument can be longer than the number of devices needed.
    seed
        The seed for the random number generator.
    maxdepth
        The maximum depth of the trees. This is 1-based, so with the default
        ``maxdepth=6``, the depths of the levels range from 0 to 5.
    precompute_predict_train
        If `True`, compute the predictions at the training points during the
        MCMC. Off by default; makes ``predict('train', ...)`` faster at the cost
        of more memory.
    init_kw
        Additional arguments passed to `bartz.mcmcstep.init`.
    run_mcmc_kw
        Additional arguments passed to `bartz.mcmcloop.run_mcmc`.

    Notes
    -----
    On gpu, the leaves of the trees are stored in float16 (see the
    ``leaf_dtype`` argument of `bartz.mcmcstep.init`), which limits the
    signal-to-noise ratio of the fit to less than about 1000, a limit that
    should always hold in realistic usage.

        x_test
            The test predictors, or the string ``'train'`` to compute
            predictions on the training data.
        kind
            The kind of output. See `PredictKind` for details.
        key
            Jax random key, required when ``kind='outcome_samples'``.
        error_scale
            Per-observation error scale. Used with ``kind='outcome_samples'``,
            and also with ``kind='mean'`` or ``'mean_samples'`` for binary
            outcomes (since the success probability is ``Phi(latent /

            and ``x_test`` is new data. Shape matches the shape used at
            fitting: ``(m,)`` for scalar scales, ``(k, m)`` for multivariate
            per-component scales.
